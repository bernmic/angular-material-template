# AngularMaterialTemplate

This project is a simple template of a Single Page Application (SPA). Ich uses Angular 5.1 and Angular Material 5 and is build with the angular/cli.
In the moment, no libraries beside Angular and Angular Material are used. Most of the parts and components are just the slightly modified examples from [angular.io](https://material.angular.io).  

To use this template, you need to install node/npm and angular/cli. Then you can run `npm install` in the project folder and start the application with `ng serve`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
